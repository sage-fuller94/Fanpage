        <h2>The One Man Musical Phenomenon</h2>

        <p>Bio:</p>
        <p>Jacob Collier is a 25 year old prodigy from north London, England. He brings jazz, gospel, electonic, classical, and even more styles together to create masterpieces. He recorded, arranged, performed, and produced his first album, In My Room, completely on his own, in his bedroom at his parents' house. He is mostly self-taught and has an exemplary understanding of music theory, not to mention perfect pitch with an impressive range. By the age of 25, he has been nominated for four Grammys for best arrangement, and has won every one of them. </p>
